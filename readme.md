## Project Summary

The GrowthHackers Digital Marketing Agency website is a responsive web platform designed to showcase data-driven marketing services and drive client acquisition. It serves as the digital storefront for the agency, highlighting their expertise in SEO, social media, and PPC advertising through case studies, team profiles, and an interactive contact system with location-based mapping.

The website follows a conversion-focused, clean aesthetic with balanced visual impact and data-driven content:

1. **Homepage Structure**:

   - **Hero Section**: Full-width header with value proposition + CTA button
   - **Services Grid**: 3-column cards (desktop) → 1-column stack (mobile)
   - **Case Studies**: Right-aligned cards (desktop) → top-aligned (mobile)

2. **Navigation**:

   - Sticky navbar with logo + simplified menu
   - Mobile hamburger menu with smooth dropdown

3. **Visual Hierarchy**:
   - (`#00c6bc`) for CTAs and interactive elements
   - Card-based design with consistent shadows/hover effects
   - Strategic white space between sections

### Logo
![Alt Text](assets/img/LOGO-1-NO-NAME.jpg)
The logo features a stylized bar chart with four vertical bars of varying heights. The bars alternate in color between cyan and dark blue.

Running diagonally from the bottom left to the top right is a sharp, zigzagging arrow, also in dark blue. The arrow cuts through the bars, giving a sense of dynamic movement and growth, commonly associated with financial, business, or analytics themes.

The overall design conveys progress, upward trends, and data-driven success. It's clean, modern, and likely suited for a business in finance, technology, analytics, or consulting.
